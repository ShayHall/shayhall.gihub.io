# Time Management

In Greek there are two words for time _"chronos"_ and _"kairos"_.  _Chronos_ is measured time, like the hands on a clock or the rising and setting of the sun.  _Kairos_ is more of how we perceive time, like when "time stands still".

When we think about **time management** we must recognize both of these experiences of time.  In order to not "lose track of time" or "waste time" we must pay more attention to the _chronos_ time or our whole life will slip away like the "sands of time".

Here are just a few ways to better manage time that I have learned from our class so far.

## Strategies

Time management is best done in a proactive manner.  When you are always playing catch up, the "urgent" always trumps the "important" and time is used inefficiently toward putting out fires and making up for lost time rather than attending to the tasks that are at hand.  Here are three simple ways to be proactive in your time management.

### Plotting the Course
When preparing for any task, it is important to first step back and make an assessment of necessary resources including time, information, energy, partners/guides, and physical materials.

A good estimate of how many resources will be required can come from asking a series of questions:

#### Difficulty- How hard is the task?

The first question to ask yourself is how much effort will the task require.  The more effort a task takes the more resources will most likely be required.  Time, as a precious resource, should be considered based on the difficulty of the task.

#### Complexity- How many pieces are there?

The complexity of a task contributes greatly to the amount of time it will take to complete.  [It was once said](https://twitter.com/al_the_x) that moving a 1000 one lb rocks is more complex than moving one 1000 lb rock and thus, more time consuming.

#### Risk- Are there any potential setbacks?

Not every task will be cut and dry.  Many will have rabbit-holes, booby traps, wrong turns, and other blockers that will delay or otherwise hinder the forward progress on a project.  While many of these obstacles are unforeseeable and unstoppable, many more are predictable and can be accounted for in the planning process.  

As you map out your path, there will  be opportunities to take "shortcuts".  As you consider these alternate routes to achieving your goal, it is good to ask yourself, "Does the potential time saved outweigh the risk of setback from mistakes?"

#### Yak Shave Well
Once the assessment has been made, you can begin doing the work necessary to prepare to do the work.  There might be an instinct to dive right into a project, especially when the clock is ticking, but if you take the time to prepare well, the benefits will pay off down the road.

Thorough preparation is the best remedy to difficulty, complexity, and risk.  Organization and planning will make the task easier.  It will make it possible to break a complex issue down into smaller, less complicated pieces.  And preparation can help reduce risk down the line.

### Pomodoro Estimates
When you estimate the resources needed for the task, it is good to make a note of how long each piece of the puzzle might take.  You can measure this however you want, but 25-30 minute chunks of time are a good starting place for the day to day tasks.  On bigger projects, you can add up the smaller pieces and factor in any variables to determine how many days, weeks, months or years the whole project could take.

Once you have an estimate of how long it will take, measure it.  By actually tracking 30 minute blocks of time, you will allow yourself to be guided by _chronos_ rather than _kairos_ and you will be less likely to be dragged down by one small pice of the project.


### Rest!!!

Last, but not least, is rest.  Without rest, it is hard to perform adequately.  Making time to rest is essential to more productive work.  And the rhythm of this rest matters, as well.  Rather than resting from your work, it is better to work from your rest.  Let periods of rest be the spring board from which you work rather than working until you cannot go any more and then resting.  

This rest first approach will improve the quality of your rest and the quality of your work and you will find yourself more producive than ever before.
