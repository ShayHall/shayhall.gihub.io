# Finding your path

In last week's tutorial, I showed you how to understand the importance of knowing where you are in your directory. This week we will look at how to navigate through your paths.  

Next week, in the final installment, I will show you how your new found knowledge can be utilized properly with `npm scripts`, `bower scripts`, and installs so you can make the most of your coding adventure.

### Part 2: Navigating

 It's easy for a novice dev to get lost in the many twists and turns, nooks and crannies, and hallways and corridors of the command line.  One way to help make sure you're on the right "path" is to root yourself on the highest level of the documents you will be using.  navigating the command line without leaving home base.  

To begin understanding what this means, take a look at this representation of part of my work tree:
```
├── package.json
├── specs
│   ├── full--desktop-skitch.png
│   ├── full--mobile-skitch.png
│   ├── full--tablet-skitch.png
│   ├── open-blogtab-mobile-skitch.png
│   ├── open-burger-tablet-skitch.png
├── src
│   ├── css
│   │   ├── main.css
│   │   └── normalize.css
│   ├── favicon.ico
│   ├── grid.html
│   ├── img
│   │   └── typing-monkey.png
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── js
│   │   └── main.js
│   ├── robots.txt
│   └── scss
│       ├── _common.scss
│       ├── _desktop.scss
│       ├── _grid.scss
│       ├── _mobile.scss
│       ├── _tablet.scss
│       └── main.scss
│
```
I plucked that map right off my command line.  You can also have access to your [own map](http://mama.indstate.edu/users/ice/tree/).  

- Explanation of the tree

- How to get to where you're going without leaving home. (Writing paths properly.

- Conclusion: Now you know how to find your way up and down trees, over paths and through directories.  Next week, we'll explore more advanced ways to put this skill into practice.
