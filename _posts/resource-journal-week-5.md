[PlainJS.com](https://plainjs.com/) is an easy to navigate source for the straightforward vanilla JS that we all know and love.  

The site argues in _favor_ of vanilla JavaScript over jQuery:
>Writing common and rather simple JavaScript functions for a website can nowadays be easily done in plain JS. There's no real gain from jQuery, although syntax is typically slightly shorter. However, that comes with the price of downloading and parsing a huge library. Yet, when writing complex JavaScript tools, such as image editors or charting libraries, both the dependency upon and the [lowerer speed of jQuery](http://vanilla-js.com/) are real drawbacks. Therefore, such code is mostly written in pure JavaScript. Again, no need for jQuery.

There are two main links on the left when you get to the page.  If what you want is good old fashioned JavaScript, stay away from the [`Plugins`](https://plainjs.com/javascript/plugins/) and go straight for the [`Functions`](https://plainjs.com/javascript/) page.

Here you will find color-coded guides to sections like [`Selecting`](https://plainjs.com/javascript/selecting/), [`Traversing`](https://plainjs.com/javascript/traversing/), and even [`Ajax`](https://plainjs.com/javascript/ajax/).  

Each option can be quickly scanned to see what it does, what _plain_ JavaScript term is associated with it and it even offers a bonus of jQuery alternatives (presumably for those who learned jQuery first and realized they don't know what they're doing).

Once you click on the topic you want to explore, you will find much more information with plenty of explanation and examples.  There's even a note at the bottom that reads:
>All functions work properly in IE 9 and above - most of them are compatible with IE 8. Common pitfalls are mentioned alongside concerned functions. Available plugins have no dependencies and are tested in IE 9+, some work properly in IE 8 and below.

Hopefully, you will find this site helpful and easy to use as you move toward being a JavaScript Wizard.
