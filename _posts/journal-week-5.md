# Puzzles

I love puzzles of all kinds, but I especially love literal puzzles, the kind that come in a box full of cardboard dust.  My favorite puzzles are 1000-2000 pieces.  They offer enough of a challenge without the long-term commitment of the super large puzzles.

About two weeks ago, I got the card table out of the closet and began working on a 1500 piece puzzle in my office.  My wife said I was crazy to start a puzzle in the midst of The Iron Yard class, and she was probably right, but I had a plan.

Puzzles help me relax, because they give me a sense of accomplishment, control and order in what is often a fairly chaotic life full of opportunities to fail that are out of my hands, especially during this season of learning.  My plan was to work on the puzzle during the breaks between sessions of slamming my head against the hard brick wall called JavaScript.  (It's starting to make sense why the front-end symbol is a stack of bricks.)

Last week, all the pieces of the puzzle finally came together!  I finished the puzzle and stepped back to admire my work.  It was done... _almost_.  There was one piece missing.  _ONE PIECE!_  I had put together 1,499 pieces of a puzzle and there was just **1** piece missing!

As I stared at the gaping puzzle-piece-sized-hole in the middle of the otherwise completed puzzle, I realized the puzzle spread out before me on my card table was a symbol of my week at The Iron Yard.  Last week it seemed as if so many pieces of the JavaScript puzzle were starting to come together for me.  I thought I was doing so well.  Things that just two weeks ago would completely stump me or take hours to figure out, I was doing with almost no thought what-so-ever.

But at the end of the day, it seems like _this_ puzzle called JavaScript will never be complete.  Each piece I find only reveals the many pieces that I haven't even begun to sort out of the box yet.  And so I sort through the pieces, trying to find the next one that will fit.
