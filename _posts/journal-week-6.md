Six weeks ago I couldn't tell you what a programming language meant or did.  I didn't know a DOM from a VIM from a CLI.  The amazing thing is that after just six weeks of The Iron Yard all those symbols above are not only recognizable to me, but essential pieces of my life.

This week we looked deeper into the wonderful world of Sass.  At first Sass seemed to be a superficial way of visualizing CSS to look more like the nested HTML elements they affect, but with variables and functions, Sass is now showing it's true power.

Templates and Lodash continue to haught me with PTSD like symptoms every time I pass a man with facial hair.  However, with Angular JS and some practice, I'm learning to love the 'stache.

In the past week, I have also been equipped with many tools to further empower me in my quest to take over the internet...  Well, at least to make my life a little easier as I fumble through one webpage after another.

Bower, git flow, Trello, and the clearfix hack have lowered my stress level and increased productivity exponentially.  So much so, that I was even able to read up on Atomic Web Design and put a slidedown menu into my blog.
