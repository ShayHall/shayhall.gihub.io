# Finding your path

In this tutorial, I will help you understand the importance of knowing where you are in your directory and how that can be utilized for `npm scripts`, `bower scripts`, installs and navigating the command line without leaving home base.


- Starting from the beginning.

Right now my terminal shows this:
```
cathyhall at MacBook-Air in ~/Desktop/TIY/shayhall.github.io (journal-week-5)
$
```

Your terminal will have something similar.  Perhaps you have navigated all the way back to the beginning and so your terminal looks like this:
```
cathyhall at MacBook-Air in ~
$
```
(That was a hint for you to open your terminal and **look at it**.  You ask, "What do those words and symbols mean and why does it matter?"

In my case `cathyhall` is the owner.  (I stole my computer from my wife).
`MacBook-Air` is the super creative name of my computer.

`~`

`/`

`Desktop/`

`(journal-week-5)`
