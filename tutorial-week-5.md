# Finding your path

In this tutorial, I will help you understand the importance of knowing where you are in your directory, how to navigate through your relative paths, and how that can be utilized for `npm scripts`, `bower scripts`, installs and navigating the command line without leaving home base.


### Getting your bearings
To begin with we will start from the beginning.  Right now my terminal shows this:
```
cathyhall at MacBook-Air in ~/Desktop/TIY/shayhall.github.io (journal-week-5)
$
```

Your terminal should have something similar.  Perhaps you have navigated all the way back to the beginning and so your terminal looks like this:
```
cathyhall at MacBook-Air in ~
$
```
(That was a hint for you to open your terminal and **look at it**.  So, you open your terminal and ask, "What do those words and symbols mean and why does it matter?"

Each person's environment is set up a little differently depending on if you have `zsh` or `prezto` or other things set up.  I'll use my computer's configurations as an example to get you started.

`cathyhall`- This is the owner.  (I stole my computer from my wife).

`MacBook-Air`- This is the super creative name of my computer.

`~`- This is the root directory.

`/`- This means that whatever is to the left is a directory or folder can can contain files and other directories.

`Desktop/TIY/shayhall.github.io`- Desktop is a directory within the root directory.  Inside Desktop is a directory called `TIY` and inside `TIY` is something called `shayhall.github.io`.  

`shayhall.github.io`- This is also a directory, but it's more than that.  It is where a git repository has been established.  You will know when you have navigated into a repository when you see something like this:

`(journal-week-5)`- This tells me what branch of my repository I am on.

### Navigating

 navigating the command line without leaving home base.

### The Path of least resistance

how that can be utilized for `npm scripts`, `bower scripts`, installs.
