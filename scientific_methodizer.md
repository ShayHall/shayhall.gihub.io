# [Scientific Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method)
#### _Replacing the madness of your method with some science._


Sticking to the scientific method for the majority of your coding process will save time, energy, confusion, and quite possibly your sanity. Early in your coding life, everything is new.  This means the world of computers is dark and scary, but it also means there are lots of lightbulbs waiting to be turned on.  The **scientific method** will help ensure there are more bright bulbs and goals met rather than just confused shrugs and targets hit and you won't end up like this guy:

1. Formulate Hypothesis

  - Rather than _guess_ and test, formulate a hypothesis first.

  - You don't have all the answers, but you do have some. Use them!

  - Ask yourself, "_Why_ am I choosing to do this thing?  Why do I think it will do what I think it will do?"

1. Develop Testable Predictions

  - Be clear about what you think will result from putting your hypothesis to the test will do.

  - Set a clear expectation of what will come from your action.

  - Ask yourself, "_What_ do I think will happen when I do this?

1. Gather Data to Test Predictions

  - When (not if, but when) things don't go as expected, take a moment to learn from that.

  - Even if things do what you think they should do, take a moment to reflect on whether it happened for the reasons you believed.  Sometimes, you can get to the right destination by the wrong route.

  - Ask yourself, "What _did_ happen?  Why did that happened instead of what I expected?"

1. Rinse and Repeat (Refine your theory and walk through it again.)

    - When you make adjustments, don't change everything.  Change just one thing!

    - **Change just ONE thing.** It's worth repeating, because it's essential.

    - Ask yourself, "What one thing do I think will bring me closer to the answer?"


If you follow these simple steps and ask yourself these simple questions, your process for discovery will become clearer and more productive.  Your successes will be earned and understood, and your mistakes will be valuable learning opportunities.
