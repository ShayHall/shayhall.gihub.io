Draft Thesis #1_

# Software Developers:
### Making Life Easier for the Little People

> #### _"A Smurf can smurf so that Smurfs can smurf better."_ -al-the-x

This journal entry will be a reflection on how a developer's main job is to make life easier for all the smurfs out there smurfing along.  I hope to incorporate MVC pattern of software design for expressing the ["core of the solution"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) to a problem in an adaptable way for each system.
