This website is an easy to navigate source for the straightforward vanilla JS that we all know and love.

There are two main nav buttons on the left when you get to the page.  If what you want is good old fashioned JavaScript stay away from the `Plugins` and go straight for the [`Functions`](https://plainjs.com/javascript/) tab.

Here you will find color-coded guides to sections like [`Selecting`](https://plainjs.com/javascript/selecting/), [`Traversing`](https://plainjs.com/javascript/traversing/), and even [`Ajax`](https://plainjs.com/javascript/ajax/).  

Each option can be quickly scanned to see what it does, what _plain_ JavaScript term is associated with it and it even offers a bonus of jQuery alternatives.  Once you click on the topic you want to explore, you will find much more information with plenty of explanation and examples.
