# Puzzles

I love to do puzzles. Yup, literal puzzles.  1000-2000 piece puzzles are my favorite.  About two weeks ago I got the card table out and began working on a 1500 piece puzzle in my office.  My wife said I was crazy to start a puzzle in the midst of The Iron Yard class, but I had a plan.

Puzzles are soothing to me because they give me a sense of accomplishment and order in what is often a fairly chaotic life full of opportunities to fail.  My plan was to work on the puzzle during my breaks between sessions of slamming my head against the hard brick wall called JavaScript.  (It's starting to make sense why the front-end symbol is a stack of bricks.)

Last week, all the pieces finally came together!  I finished the puzzle and stepped back to admire my work.  It was done... Almost.  There was one piece missing.  I had put together 1,499 pieces and there was **1** missing!

I can tell almost the same story for my educational experiences last week.  It seemed as if so many pieces of the JavaScript puzzle were starting to come together for me.  I was doing so well, I thought.  Things that just two weeks ago would completely stump me or take hours to figure out, I was doing with almost no thought what-so-ever.

But at the end of the day, it seems like _this_ puzzle will never be complete.  Each piece I find only reveals the many that I haven't even begun to sort out of the box yet.
