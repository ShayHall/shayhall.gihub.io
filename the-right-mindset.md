#The Right Mindset:
##_How Improv Prepared Me for Coding_
![Two Mindsets](http://www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/mindset.jpg)
##### Draft 1
A person can move through life with one of two mindsets, a fixed mindset or a growth mindset.  A fixed mindset is self-conscious and fear driven.  The desire to prove worth and ability tends to create a situation that affirms rather than relieves the fear of failure.  A person with a fixed mindset avoids challenges and thus cannot succeed or even improve.  The fixed minded individual compares his or her own abilities to those around them, takes constructive feedback as belittling criticism, and does not believe the effort to improve is worth the effort it takes to get there or the risk of failure involved in trying so they often give up before they ever start.

A growth mindset, on the other hand, embraces the possibility of "what if".  Inspired and encouraged by the success and feedback of others, these people focus on the outward potential rather than the inward deficiencies.  They move hopefully into the unknown expecting to fail, to learn, and to grow.

When people first encounter improvisational acting, it quickly becomes evident if they are fixed or growth minded.  The basis of improv is taking nothing and creating something by taking risks, trusting others, and embracing everything as a gift.  Very few people step onto a stage for the first time to perform an improv scene and immediately produce Shakespearean level work.  Those with a fixed mindset are frightened and insecure by their self-imposed expectations of what they "ought" to do.  

Those with a growth mindset embrace the mantra "Yes, and..." by openly accepting whatever happens, saying "yes" to what others might see as "mistakes" and building on those "failures" to create something even better than what they could have imagined.  This is possible by focusing on the other actor(s) on stage, listening and responding to what they offer and trying to make them look good rather than worrying about one's own performance.

My experience with improv has revealed the potential in me for either mindset.  I can become like a blackhole, turning inward with fear and self-consciousness worrying about failure until I consume myself or I can relax, trust those around me and look for the gems hidden in every setback, dim light, or block.  I've stepped onto the stage and the only way for this scene to fail if for me to not play.
