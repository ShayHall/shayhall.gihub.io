#The Right Mindset:
##_How Improv Prepared Me for Coding_
![Two Mindsets](http://www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/mindset.jpg)

A person can move through life with one of two mindsets; <a href=http://mindsetonline.com/whatisit/about/> fixed or growth.</a>  A fixed mindset is self-conscious and fear driven.  The desire to prove worth and ability tends to create a situation that affirms rather than relieves the fear of failure.  A person with a fixed mindset avoids challenges and thus cannot succeed or even improve.  The fixed minded individual compares his or her own abilities to those around them, takes constructive feedback as belittling criticism, and does not believe the effort to improve is worth the effort it takes to get there or the risk of failure involved in trying so they often give up before they ever start.

A growth mindset, on the other hand, embraces the possibility of "what if".  Inspired and encouraged by the success and feedback of others, these people focus on the outward potential rather than the inward deficiencies.  They move hopefully into the unknown expecting to fail, to learn, and to grow.

When people first encounter improvisational acting, it quickly becomes evident if they are fixed or growth minded.  The basis of improv is taking nothing and creating something by taking risks, trusting others, and embracing everything as a gift.  Very few people step onto a stage for the first time to perform an improv scene and <a href=https://www.khanacademy.org/youcanlearnanything>immediately produce Shakespearean level work.</a>  Those with a fixed mindset are frightened and insecure by their self-imposed expectations of what they "ought" to do <a href=https://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve>so they end up doing nothing.</a>  They never try, so they never fail, but they also never grow, learn, or succeed.  Debbie Millman said, <a href=http://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/>“If you imagine less, less will be what you undoubtedly deserve...Do what you love, and don’t stop until you get what you love. Work as hard as you can, imagine immensities...”</a>

Those with a growth mindset embrace the mantra <a href=http://ideaschoolsnetwork.com/yes-and/>"Yes, and..."</a> by openly accepting whatever happens, saying "yes" to what others might see as "mistakes" and building on those "failures" to create something even better than what they could have imagined.  This is possible by focusing on the other actor(s) on stage, listening and responding to what they offer and trying to make them look good rather than worrying about one's own performance.

My experience with improv has revealed the potential in me for either mindset.  I can become like a blackhole, turning inward with fear and self-consciousness worrying about failure until I consume myself or I can relax, trust those around me and look for the gems hidden in every setback, dim light, or block.  I've stepped onto the stage and the only way for this scene to fail if for me to not play.

I recently closed to doors on a ten year dream of starting a new church community.  It would have been easy to look back on the past ten years of dreaming and 2+ years of _the hardest work I have ever done_ and feel an overwhelming sense of **failure**, questioning every step of the process and myself as a whole.  But improv has taught me to <a href=http://nymag.com/news/features/27840/>learn from the struggles</a> and lean into what the future could bring, but I've grown a lot over the last several years, and the last few weeks, in particular about who I am and the possibilities of what I can do.  I've also learned that the learning and personal growth that comes from failing often out weighs the negative consequences of the shortfall.  

As I sit at my desk late at night, poking away at Yak-Shaving and debugging everything I touch, I remind myself that the <a href= http://blogs.wsj.com/informedreader/2007/02/13/the-praise-a-child-should-never-hear/>effort is what counts most</a>.  Instead of getting frustrated and discouraged by every wrong turn, I am trying to see each "mistake" as an opportunity to say, "Yes, and... I will learn from this and be better because it in the end."
